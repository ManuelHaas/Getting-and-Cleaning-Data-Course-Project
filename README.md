# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Github repository with the script for performing the analysis of the "Getting and Cleaning Data Course" Project

This Repo works with data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The script [run_analysis.R](/run_analysis.R) in the main directory can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory. The output will be a tidy data set as stated in the [CodeBook](/CodeBook.md)
